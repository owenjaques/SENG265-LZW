Select Qualitative Feedback:
===========================

Formatting 
...
Almost Up to mark.
One issue: Make sure all the functions are using same tab spaces. 
For example, read12 and write12 should be in-sync with rest of the code.

Naming
...

Good naming conventions for variables/functions.


Commenting
...

Good use of comments to describe functionality.


Functional Decomposition
...

Good use of code segmentation. Nice work.
